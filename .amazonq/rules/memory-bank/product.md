# Unified Security Scanner - Product Overview

## Project Purpose
A comprehensive security scanning platform specifically designed for npm/React projects that achieves industry-leading false positive reduction (<5%). The scanner orchestrates multiple security tools (TruffleHog, Semgrep, custom scanners) to provide comprehensive vulnerability detection with intelligent filtering.

## Key Features & Capabilities

### Multi-Tool Orchestration
- Seamlessly integrates TruffleHog for secrets detection
- Leverages Semgrep for pattern-based vulnerability scanning
- Supports custom scanner modules for specialized detection
- Unified reporting across all scanning tools

### False Positive Reduction
- ML-powered filtering algorithms
- Rule-based exclusion patterns
- Context-aware analysis for test files and configuration templates
- Achieves <5% false positive rate through intelligent filtering

### React/npm Specialization
- Custom rules for React hooks and Context API vulnerabilities
- npm package security analysis including typosquatting detection
- Dependency confusion attack prevention
- React-specific vulnerability patterns (dangerouslySetInnerHTML, localStorage misuse)

### Security Detection Capabilities
- **Secrets & Credentials**: API keys, OAuth tokens, private keys, database connections, JWT tokens
- **React Vulnerabilities**: Unsafe DOM manipulation, hardcoded secrets in hooks, Context API misuse
- **Package Security**: Malicious packages, typosquatting, dependency confusion, vulnerable dependencies
- **Technical Debt**: Outdated packages, EOL dependencies, upgrade path recommendations

### Output & Integration
- Multiple output formats: SARIF 2.1.0 (GitHub Security), JSON, HTML dashboard, terminal
- Native GitHub Actions support with Security tab integration
- CI/CD ready for all major platforms (GitLab, Jenkins, etc.)
- Interactive HTML dashboard with filtering and charts

## Target Users & Use Cases

### Primary Users
- **Development Teams**: Integrate security scanning into development workflow
- **DevSecOps Engineers**: Implement automated security checks in CI/CD pipelines
- **Security Teams**: Monitor and assess security posture of React/npm applications
- **Open Source Maintainers**: Ensure security compliance in public repositories

### Key Use Cases
- **Pre-commit Security Checks**: Catch vulnerabilities before code reaches repository
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Automated security scanning on pull requests and releases
- **Security Audits**: Comprehensive security assessment of existing codebases
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generate security reports for compliance requirements
- **Technical Debt Management**: Track and prioritize security-related technical debt

## Value Proposition
- **Reduced False Positives**: <5% false positive rate saves developer time and reduces alert fatigue
- **React/npm Focus**: Specialized detection for the most common JavaScript ecosystem vulnerabilities
- **Unified Workflow**: Single tool replaces multiple security scanners with consistent reporting
- **CI/CD Native**: Built for modern development workflows with native GitHub integration
- **Actionable Results**: Provides clear remediation guidance and upgrade paths
